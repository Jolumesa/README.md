As a motivated web development student with real-world tech support experience and a passion for building user-facing applications, I believe I'd bring a unique blend of technical ability and people skills to your team.

I’ve built and deployed a tasks management application using Angular, available at https://tasks-management-delta.vercel.app, and continue to grow my skills through courses like Angular Developer (Udemy). 
My prior roles at Kaiser Permanente and Amazon allowed me to strengthen my communication, problem-solving, and teamwork skills that directly translate to a development environment.

I’m eager to contribute to your team while continuing to grow as a developer. I’d love the chance to speak further and share what I can bring to your projects.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Best regards,
